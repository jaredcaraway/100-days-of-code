## Log

### R1D1 - March 24, 2018
I learned some new Terminal commands today - if you press Ctrl+W, you can delete a word at a time. If you want to repeat a command, hold Alt and type in the number of times you want it repeated, followed by the keyboard shortcut - so to delete the last three words you've entered, you'd press Alt+3 followed by Ctrl+W. Nifty.

I recently upgraded my laptop's HDD to a SSD, and the difference is amazing. I put the old HDD into my desktop PC upstairs (which is also now primarily running on an SSD) as a secondary drive. I also installed Mint Linux on both, and I'm loving it so far - my last daily OS was Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and so far I haven't really missed it (largely because they're so similar).

The downside to the new SSD on my laptop is that I didn't transfer anything over, so I'm starting from scratch. This has caused a bit of a headache when I start working on a project on one and switch to the other; I realized I needed a solution to sync files between the two machines. After experimenting with a manual networking setup that wasn't quite to my satisfaction and a very disappointing implementation of Dropbox, I discovered the free open-source utility called Syncthing. I installed it on both machines, added a startup command for both so that the server runs whenever I start either one, and dropped the stuff I wanted shared into the default directory that was created in my home directory...and it worked with no hassle at all. It's exactly what I needed, and it's going to make my work a lot smoother.

I am currently learning binary trees. I understand the basic concepts, now I just need to figure out how to get them to translate into code. This is going to require relearning recursion, which I haven't worked with in some time. Ultimately, I'll use this knowledge to solve a coding problem that is asking me to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. I could switch to Python and use their built-in "pickling" functionality, but I think I'm going to remain focused on JavaScript until I have obtained a fairly solid mastery of the language.

### R1D2 - March 25, 2018
Today I continued my education on binary trees. I was initially confused about how to decide which node to set as root - take the middle element in an array, maybe? I asked the question on an IRC channel I frequent, and someone clarified that it doesn't really matter, since the tree will sort itself out when done properly. It seems like you can just start with the first element in an array, whether or not it's sorted, and get largely the same result as if you'd started in the middle. An interesting feature of a binary tree is that it will often not be balanced - the left and right subtrees will not be symmetrical.

I learned that there are, as far as I know, only two search algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS). In the former, you search starting with the root and examining first the left and then the right child nodes, then the left and right nodes of each of those nodes, and so on until you've searched the entire tree or found the search term. With DFS, you search along the left edge of the tree until you hit a node with no further left children, search the right child node (if any), then return to the level above to check the right nodes backward to the root node, at which point you begin the same search pattern starting with the root node's right child.

In the process of learning about binary trees, I did a bit of reading on heaps as well. They follow a similar form of organization, but do not have the same strict sorting criteria. Heaps tend to be more balanced than binary trees in terms of overall structure, but are not as efficient.

I'd really like to jump in and start coding the answer to the binary search tree serialization problem, but I'm finding that educating myself before going in blind is probably the better way to go. Binary trees appear to be an important concept that I'll need to have in my toolbox, so it's better for me to take the time to understand the concept rather than stitch together some code that's just good enough to solve the coding challenge but which I'll quickly forget about as I move forward.

### R1D3 - March 26, 2018
Today, my coding focused mainly on the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. Creating a MEAN app involves a lot of moving parts - creating routes, installing packages, creating data models for my database - but it's fascinating seeing under the hood at how everything interconnects.

I continued my education on the topic of binary trees as well today. In the process, I homed in on the subject of classes in JavaScript. An interesting fact I learned about JS classes is that, since it is a prototype-based language, creating an instance of a JS object does not simply make a copy based on the class template; the instance is linked to the prototype, and any methods or attributes added to the prototype after objects are instantiated will add that data to the preexisting objects. I never would have guessed!

### R1D4 - March 27, 2018
More binary trees today, sort of - I looked into the concept of recursion, which I've used before...almost a decade and a half ago in my C++ class! I will need to use this when constructing a binary tree from an array, so I decided to do a little more research. I learned about the execution context stack, which keeps track of the state of your variables and the current line number when a function is called. If the function calls itself from within, a new context is added to the top of the stack. Assuming you haven't coded an infinite loop, new contexts will continue being added until a condition is met, at which point the JavaScript engine traverses the execution context stack from top to bottom until the stack has been cleared. With this knowledge, the binary tree problem is really starting to take focus in my mind. I think I will whiteboard the contexts for clarity when I'm writing the code so I can visualize what's going on. 

I also returned to the MEAN stack and learned, with the help of the Mongoose package, how to create an object according to a defined schema and save it to MongoDB. As a side note, since this requires me to run Angular, Node, and MongoDB in separate terminals, I figured out the keyboard shortcut to quickly move a window to a new workspace (basically, a distinct desktop context), how to rename the workspace for clarity, and how to switch the active workspace. I also added a function to my .bashrc file which allows me to rename the terminal window with a single command for further clarity; I've got a pretty tidy workspace with minimal clutter, which allows me to better focus on the task at hand (instead of Alt-Tabbing through a number of unnamed terminals that I do not need to interact with).

Finally, I finished chapter three of my agile book, which deals with the concepts of continuing to learn to prevent stagnation, sharing that new information with your team to collectively increase knowledge so your team is richer for it as a whole, and unlearning old habits and techniques that may have been superseded by something better. As a lifelong learner, I don't think I'll have any problem with this aspect of agility in my professional development career - I love picking up new concepts.

### R1D5 - March 28, 2018
Today I learned the build flow that is followed when assembling an Angular component (which requires *so many* files), and I also learned how to apply custom styling to that particular component. I am getting some exposure to TypeScript in the process, and it really isn't difficult at all. In fact, I'm having a hard time distinguishing it from regular JavaScript so far - but I'm barely scratching the surface, so I don't want to speak too soon.

I also learned how to apply two-way data binding between an input field and a respective output field via string interpolation. Having done this previously in Vue, I have to say I appreciate Vue's syntax more, but I appear to be accomplishing the *exact same thing* in Angular.

On the non-coding front, I read part of chapter 4 in my agile book, spoke to a friend in the tech industry who works for a major corporation and got a few pointers, and listened to a couple of Base.cs podcast episodes dealing with binary trees. My daily coding problem emails continue to pile up in my inbox, but they're really not a priority at the moment - I can't rush progress, and I have to be realistic about that.

When flipping through job postings again today, it occurred to me that one of the skills I lack completely is .NET/C# proficiency - traditionally Windows-based technology. I discovered that it's possible to develop for this framework/language pair on Linux and went ahead and set up my environment with MonoDevelop and .NET Core, but I refrained from getting too deep into my exploration for fear of winding up in a rabbit hole and losing sight of my current objectives. One thing at a time.

### R1D6 - March 29, 2018
My journey into Angular is exciting, if a little overwhelming. I know, as with anything else I've learned, that it's a matter of repetition and habit, so I'm trying not to sidetrack myself so I can get in a little bit of learning every day and build familiarity by working with it on a regular basis. I'm still just following tutorials, but I'm anxious to take the training wheels off and try out what I'm learning on a project I build entirely myself. There isn't anything I'm learning that is very difficult to understand, but the sheer granularity of the project file structure is taking some adjusting. But I'm confident that I'll be competent in Angular before I even realize it's happened.

Today I continued on into property binding and learned how to pass properties between components. I also learned event binding, which allows me to call a function upon clicking a component with an appropriate binding. I'm still getting used to the concept of sharing data between components...it's all a matter of repetition.

I keep seeing continuous integration/deployment mentioned on job postings, so I've installed Jenkins on my system to begin getting acquainted with it. I'm honestly not sure yet that any of my little projects/experiments can benefit greatly from it, but I believe it'll be valuable for me to familiarize myself with the process for when the scope of my work increases in complexity.

My OS of choice at the moment is Linux Mint. A handy thing I learned today is that you can open additional tabs in Terminal - I had absolutely no idea! When working locally on the MEAN project (Mongo/Express/Angular/Node) I'm on at the moment, I need to run Node in one terminal, the front-end build in another, and MongoDB in a third. This became cumbersome to do repeatedly, so I (with the help of some Googling) wrote a Bash script that opens all three terminal instances (tabbed, now that I know such a thing is possible) by running a single command. It's not much, but it'll speed up my workflow marginally. I've been basically running Linux distros full-time for at least the past seven months, and every day I realize that I've still only scratched the surface of what I can do with the right commands. Learning terminal has been a huge step forward for me as a developer...I've got decades of experience in Windows, but I always relied mainly on GUI. In Linux, I always try to find a CLI-based method for doing stuff. With tab autocompletion, it's so much quicker.

### R1D7 - April 1, 2018
Writing my Bash script yesterday to automate the opening of multiple terminal windows and running commands within each gave me a big confidence boost, so it led me to examine my process for posting/tweeting about these logs. My basic workflow is as follows: Write about what I did today, commit that, push it to the master branch on origin, switch to browser and open repo page, copy link to log, open Twitter and click tweet button, manually type my tweet and paste link to log, then send it out.

I devised a script rather quickly that allows me to push my staged commit (I may revise to include the actual committing in the script, but for now I'll do it manually), then automatically open a new tab in my browser with a Twitter [web intent](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/web-intent) containing a boilerplate with a link to my log (it is always the same file and thus the same URL). This cuts out *so much* of the stuff in the middle! I'm pretty happy about it. The downside is that the web intent doesn't appear to have a built-in character counter...I'll look into whether I can get it to pop up, as I've seen it present when using it in other contexts.

I took a little break from my Angular learning tonight to watch the first lecture in the MIT 6.006 course, which I've seen recommended on multiple occasions to people like me who are pursuing a career in the programming world (without the benefit of actually going to school for it). An understanding of common algorithms is crucial to writing and understanding code, and this course appears to be devoted entirely to such a topic. The first video is called "Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding." So far, I'm enjoying it. I'm hopeful that this will help me as I continue knocking out coding algorithm challenges.

### R1D8 - April 2, 2018
Today I continued learning about Angular, but took a step back for a bit to learn about some of the basic concepts upon which Angular builds - beginning with modules. The module system has been unfamiliar to me since I began my Angular journey, and I learned that it's a concept not unique to Angular, but intrinsic to JavaScript ES6 itself (and, if I understand correctly, the future of JS as we know it).

Each module has a scope that is, by default, local rather than global. This causes modules to be agnostic of one another until you explicitly export (that is, make public) a function, class, var, let, or const. This allows for code splitting, which in turn allows for a neater structure and separation of concerns for various scripts.

I alternate between my desktop PC upstairs and my laptop, which I sometimes use upstairs in parallel with the desktop and often take downstairs with me. I originally had set up SyncAnything on both machines, thinking it would be a good idea to just drop the repos I'm working on into my Sync folder to have them automatically mirrored onto both machines. This actually caused some issues with Git, so I reverted to just pulling a local copy to each machine in a non-synced folder. Sometimes I'll shut down my desktop to come downstairs for the night, but I'm not down writing out my log for the day. To remedy this, I've started creating a branch and pushing it to origin so I could then pull it onto my laptop while I'm downstairs to finish it up and post.

This works well enough, but I found after merging and deleting my local branch that the remote branch still persisted. It's possible to log onto Github and remove the remote branch via GUI, but I always opt for a CLI method when it's available. This led me to learn a new skill - deleting remote branches via terminal! It's a bit counterintuitive, but all you do is `git push origin --delete branchNameHere` and that pesky remote branch vanishes. I feel fairly competent in Git by now, but I still have so much left to learn before I can truly say I've mastered it.

I spent a lot of time tonight looking for a good CMS/admin panel to pop onto the MEAN-stack-based project I'm preparing to begin on for a client. For selfish/practice reasons (see: my portfolio), I'm wanting to go the Node route rather than just throwing together something in WordPress (which would be much quicker and easier, if overkill for this particular project). There doesn't seem to be a clear candidate at this point, as a lot of the frameworks I'm finding seem not to be fully fleshed out or are not still being actively developed.

I think there's a compromise - WordPress recently merged a branch into its core which brought REST API access, which would allow me to connect to WP on the backend while building the frontend using Angular. I'd go full MEAN stack if my client didn't need to update their website rather frequently, but I want it to be easy for them to maintain their content without my assistance (although I'll still need to jump in on occasion to apply updates, but I'll be hosting it for them and can do that quickly with the awesome WP CLI). I haven't made a final decision just yet, but I'm leaning heavily in that direction.

### R1D9 - April 3, 2018
Today I learned, [thanks to a great Base CS post by Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8), about the basics of graph theory. It's not nearly as complicated as I might've imagined - it covered both directed and undirected graphs and how they differ from trees (although trees are in fact graphs, too). It also briefly examined how relationships on social networks are represented as undirected graphs (Facebook, where a friendship is mutual, a.k.a. bidirectional) and directed graphs (Twitter, where you can follow someone and not be followed in return, a.k.a. directional). I can already envision how to potentially model vertices and edges in JSON format, so I'll be one step ahead when it comes time to apply such concepts in code.

Returning again to Git, I noticed when running the command `git branch -a` that my remote branch I thought to be deleted was still showing in my listing of all branches. Unsurprisingly, [there's a Git command to take care of that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5094293/git-remote-branch-deleted-but-still-appears-in-branch-a), and it's a fairly logical one. When you've got a dead branch, much like you'd have on an actual tree or bush, you want to remove it by pruning. Running `git remote prune origin` was all it took to clean up the dead branch and provide an accurate, updated listing of my local and remote branches. I love it (and Stack Overflow, ornery though some of the dwellers there may be)!

In Bash news, I wrote what may be my first functions in my .bash_aliases file. I've written plain old aliases before (where, for example, you might type `projectName` instead of the much more verbose `cd ~/to/your/project/directory`), but I found that a simple alias didn't allow you to work with arguments. I often move files around from the command line and want to immediately change into the directory I just moved the file into, so I created a `mvcd()` function. Instead of typing `mv fileName ~/to/the/target/directory` followed by `cd ~/to/the/target/directory`, I wrap it all into one and just run `mvcd fileName ~/to/the/target/directory`. This moves the file, changes me into the directory I just moved it to, and as a bonus runs `ls` once I'm there to show me a listing of what's in the directory...all in a single command. There's a lot of untapped potential in Bash scripting, and I'm looking forward to getting deeper into it. On a simpler note, I learned that `cd -` will change you back into the last directory you were in. Very handy shortcut.

I finally began drawing out a basic wireframe for my current client's site. I haven't been procrastinating, but all of the background research and tutorials I've been going through have been taking up so much time that I'd temporarily lost sight of the project itself. I decided that, regardless of what architecture I end up using for development, I need to start moving forward with the design itself. I began with pen and paper and attempted to load a picture of my sketch into InVision, but ran into some frustrating issues with my photo orientation (no matter how it showed up in my file explorer, it kept uploading as landscape rather than portrait and I could not change it in the app). I ultimately switched over to another tool with a freemium model, MockFlow, and began wireframing digitally. If I can come up with a more solid workflow, I'll probably go back to starting with pen and paper, but I ultimately will want my sketches digitized in any event.

### R1D10 - April 4, 2018
Today's log will be pretty short, because I didn't actually get around to coding anything. I'm working on one of my more ambitious web projects (which is what a lot of the aforementioned tutorials and learning have been aimed toward), and as anxious as I am to start working on the mechanics of the site, I realized that the proper thing to do would be to invest some more time into researching, planning, and designing the thing before I got in too deep and realized I needed to undo my work.

I say ambitious because my client runs an events company that puts on several distinct events, which effectively function as separate sub-brands under their umbrella. I am currently trying to work out the best way to structure the data and navigation, and I'm working from a mobile-first perspective...which is far more challenging than I'd anticipated. The good news is that once I have the mobile experience planned to my (and, more importantly, my client's) satisfaction, I believe the design for larger viewports will go much more quickly; it's just a matter of unpacking what I've crammed into a small space.

So tonight, my coding time was instead spent Googling furiously and sketching out several different iterations of prospective nav configurations. I've found some ideas that I really like, but the challenge will be converting those into code effectively. I also would really like to use Angular and Node to get the experience on my resume, but the fact is that what I want comes second to what will ultimately work best for the client. I'm looking at several different candidates for frameworks and libraries for the functionality I'm after. I feel like I'm a competent developer, but I'm hardly an expert (yet). If the functionality I'm planning to implement can be pulled off with a pre-existing library, assuming it doesn't have a substantially negative impact on site performance, then I think it would be foolish and a waste of time for me to reinvent the wheel at this point. I want to do the best job I can on this project, but I also don't want to make the client wait six months for me to do everything from scratch with free-range, farm-raised, single origin, hand-crafted code. Sometimes it just makes more sense to use something that other people have gotten working before me. Once my expertise has been developed to the point that I can hammer out CSS and JS without breaking a sweat, then I feel I'll be able to justify building my own stuff entirely from the ground up (but, even then, I suspect I'll still often pull in code from others if I feel it would be best, at least on a per-project basis; I imagine simpler projects could very well benefit from 100% original code).

### R1D11 - April 7, 2018
Changing gears has been helpful in keeping me from burning out. It keeps me from getting tunnel vision and obsessing too much on one thing until it makes me sick; after all, variety is indeed the spice of life. So I started a side project: recreating the classic dice game Yahtzee in responsive web app form.

Contrary to my client website, I'm going into this project with a bit less planning. This may be a good vehicle for my foray into Node and Angular. At least for right now, I'm getting started with plain ol' vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. I chose Yahtzee because my girlfriend and I started playing it recently, and it offers a good mix of chance and strategy similar to poker (says the guy who has played maybe a few games of poker, ever). Over the course of 13 turns, each player rolls a set of five dice up to three times. On each roll, you can hold certain dice and re-roll the rest in an attempt to get a certain high-scoring pattern (the highest of them being Yahtzee, which is when all five dice match). One of the restrictions is that certain patterns can only be matched once - so if you claim a small straight (which is four dice in sequential order, such as 1/2/3/4 or 3/4/5/6), you can't get points for that pattern the rest of the game.

Programming the interface for this project will be absolutely minimal, and I think the most complicated part will be getting the rules successfully translated into code. I have a plan to allow user accounts so they can track and graph their scores over time, and that would be great practice working with databases. I don't think artifical intelligence for such a game would be all that hard, but I can also be pretty naive sometimes and this could very well be one of those times. I'll report back once I get further into the project...for now, I'm going to build it in a private Bitbucket repo. Once I set it to public, I think it might make a good repo for newbie open source contributors to add features and submit pull requests to. We'll see what happens.

My current distraction from *that* distraction is Solidity, a programming language that works with the Ethereum cryptocurrency. I have zero experience with crypto, but it's an intriguing concept to me and I honestly had no idea you could program using blockchain technology. I still have no real idea how it works, but I'd like to at least get a basic understanding to satisfy my curiosity...I doubt it'll be anything more than a temporary deviation from my "traditional" developer path.

### R1D12 - April 8, 2018
I spent *hours* today working on my Yahtzee clone, which I'm calling "Notzee." So far, all I have to show for it is a demo of a random die you can click to roll ([you can view the JSBin here](http://jsbin.com/bopijec/edit?html,css,js,output)).

I started out trying to use a single sprite with all six faces of a die combined, but since my project is light on resources I figured any prospective performance hit would be neglible and opted to pull the individual images in separately. In my HTML, all I have is one `<div>`set to the width and height of the images to be loaded in. Rather than loading the images with an `<img>` tag, I decided to load them as `background-image`s with CSS. I've got a separate class for each die face (one through six), so when I randomly roll a number I simply attach the corresponding class to the containing HTML element to have the die appear onscreen.

This demo gave me some practice using the ES6 class feature. Since I will have multiple dice, I figured having one class from which I create multiple instances would be the way to go. In each instance, I store both the current value (and class name, mapped via associative array) as well as the previous value and class name (1 and "one," for example). I've also got methods for rolling and rolling again, since the initial roll and following ones will be slightly different. I considered limiting myself to a single roll method, but broke it out for added clarity. I may review my code at a future point to determine whether refactoring would be beneficial.

I also added a basic "Roll" button with an event listener attached which, when clicked, will run the die's roll method and output the correct face of the die on the page. From here, it should be pretty straightforward to extend the functionality to five dice. I think I'll migrate my progress from JSBin to my official Notzee repo tomorrow.

### R1D13 - April 9, 2018
In an effort to keep me from throwing my attention at whatever came across my path and going down rabbit holes free of any sort of constraint, I've downloaded an add-on for my OS (Linux Mint) which adds a pomodoro timer to the task bar. For those not familiar, the pomodoro technique involves working on something distraction-free (if at all possible) for a 25-minute block, then doing something else to sort of clear your mind (browse Reddit, stretch, relax, watch a few minutes of Netflix, get a cup of coffee, use the bathroom, the choice is all yours!) for a 5-minute block. You then return to the task at hand for another 25-minute block and the cycle repeats (followed by a long break after a certain number of cycles are completed). I haven't read up on the "official" method, but my OS app has a long break set to occur after four 25-minute blocks by default (but this number is configurable).

I've found that this method actually does a good job of keeping me from getting off track. For those 25 minutes, I am doing nothing but the task currently at hand. I haven't switched gears after a short break yet, but I can see this being useful in dividing up my time if I want to switch between coding and reading part of a text or doing a tutorial. I am still coming to terms with the fact that I have a strictly limited amount of time in any given day, so I've got to make the most of it that I can given my particular set of life constraints.

As mentioned in yesterday's post, I went ahead and migrated my JSBin code into my Notzee repo. I'd ultimately like to get good enough to code everything without leaning on frameworks like Bootstrap for a crutch, but for now, I just want to get things done - so I'm leaning on Bootstrap. I've used it previously, but BS3; this time around I'm learning how to use BS4, which is a complete rewrite of the previous framework. This will help me get my app working without spending too much of my precious time on the minutiae; I can always come back and refine it after I get the baseline code in place. I mainly just want this thing to work!

Tomorrow I'm planning to get the five dice to roll and display on the screen. Tonight, I'll keep this log short.

### R1D14 - April 10, 2018
While looking for a simple background pattern for my Notzee app, I got sidetracked...but I'm okay with it, because I still got some valuable JavaScript practice in the process. I found a website I'd visited previously which has a ton of free subtle backgrounds, and the only way to navigate through each page is to scroll to the bottom and click next. I wasn't finding many that jumped out at me, so I ended up doing a lot of clicking. I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could navigate with a keyboard shortcut? So I started looking into ways to make that possible.

The first method I thought of was using a library I'd come across in the past called Mousetrap.js, which lets you bind functionality to keys/key combos with a short function call. But when I glanced at the source, I realized it was a fairly short library and that I could probably accomplish what I wanted to do with vanilla JavaScript. I use a chrome extension called TamperMonkey which injects scripts into pages to add custom functionality, so I created a new script I could plug in to the page in question.

I decided to set Ctrl+left and Ctrl+right as the shortcuts to navigate back and forth between the pages of backgrounds. To do this, I grabbed the window URL, split it, and saved the page number to a variable. I also grabbed the last page number by targeting the "Last" element on the page (which, as you might expect, jumps to the last page) and saving the page number contained in that URL to its own variable. With these numbers, I was able to make sure I didn't attempt to move to a page that didn't exist.

Getting keypresses was as simple as attaching an event listener to the document object listening for a "keydown" event. I then checked the keycode for the key and used `getModifierState("Control")` to make sure Ctrl was held down when left and right were pressed. To go forward, I checked to make sure I wouldn't go out of bounds, then either added or subtracted to the current page number, added it back to the array formed by splitting the URL, and `join`ed the array back into a string with a forward slash delimiter. Finally, I called `window.open(pageNum, "_self")` to navigate to the new page within the current tab/window.

I am still working out the only kink I've found so far, which is based on the first page having a shorter URL than the rest. It should be an easy fix, but I simply haven't done it yet. I felt a little bit silly spending so much time coding out a utility I probably would hardly ever use, but as I started mulling it over in my head I realized that it would be great for me to get some more practice with events and reading keyboard input, so I think it was a worthwhile distraction due to its pure educational content. And, as a side bonus, I'll be able to page through the background site much more quickly. I think today was a success, but I would like to make some more progress on Notzee tomorrow. I didn't use my pomodoro technique tonight, but I'll try to get back in the groove tomorrow.

### R1D15 - April 11, 2018
Today I learned that you can `git checkout` a previous commit just by entering the hash of said commit (as found in the `git log`). I wanted to show my girlfriend the progress I'd made on Notzee, so I googled how to "rewind" Git. I'd done it before using a hard reset, but that was when I wanted to actually undo some later commits. In this case, all I wanted to do was travel back in time...and checking out a specific commit was exactly what I needed for that purpose! Git continues to amaze me with its versatility and power. I don't know how I ever worked without it, honestly.

I am working on Notzee again. When I set up the first iteration, I had a fixed-size div holding the image via CSS with `background: url(...)`. However, since I want this app to be responsive, this method did not work and I thus had to refactor. I initially had an associative array mapping integers to numbers ("1" to "one") and had individual classes corresponding to the mapped strings which contained only a single property which, when applied to the container div, set the background image to the correct die face. I threw this code out, as I found it unnecessarily complicated; in place of the divs, I dropped in `<img>` tags with an empty `src` attribute and a Bootstrap `class` of `.img-fluid`. I also redid the associate array to point the die roll integers to the image assets themselves. Now, whenever I roll a die, I update the `src` attribute with JavaScript and don't have to worry about classes for that particular mechanic.

I'm excited to say that I now have all five dice displayed onscreen, each rolling a new random number when you click/tap the button. And, in line with my specifications, they resize nicely to fit any viewport. Rather than explicitly giving each die element an ID, I just created an array to hold them all in. I gather all elements with a `.die` class into an array run, then run through a `for` loop instantiating a new Die object with a random initial value as the first argument and the i-th element (based on the current index, i, in the for loop) as the second argument. This allows me to save the die container element for each die into its own object. (Hopefully that wasn't too confusing of an explanation.)

Next steps are to add a "locking" mechanism where you can toggle a die to be held so that it doesn't roll along with the others when you click the button, style the app, add a score card, and add multiplayer functionality. I am absolutely pumped about tonight's progress!

If you're interested in seeing what I have so far, [here's a link to tonight's commit](https://github.com/jaredcaraway/notzee/commit/cbe5bc6e5008e6807496e78b7ba1209d879099b5). I still need to add a basic readme, but if you want to clone a copy to see what progress I've made, all you have to do is open the .html file in a browser (I don't believe a local server is necessary).

### R1D16 - April 12, 2018
My kid actually went down for a nap for a substantial length of time today, so I was able to return to the pomodoro method and I am finding it useful, for sure - it keeps me grounded in what I'm doing. I dedicate that particular block of time to one thing and after a short break, I'm able to switch gears. Direction is one thing I still struggle with a bit on this solo journey into code.

I spent an hour or so today going through the code for a self-hosted IRC client called The Lounge. I really want to find one I can pick apart and more or less understand so I can start contributing to an open-source project. I looked at a few issues and tried to trace what was happening in the code with little success; this may not be the best candidate for me to get my feet wet, as it deals heavily with networking and I am not yet adept with networking concepts. The scale of this project may also be ambitious for me given my current level of expertise - I'm going to keep looking until I find something better suited to my experience.

I continued work on Notzee today; I now have the locking mechanism working. When you click on a die, it toggles a red border around it to indicate that it is "locked" and will not change value when the roll button is clicked. Clicking again on the die will unlock it. I was actually kind of amazed at how simple this feature was to add. The major challenges still lie ahead, but I'm looking forward to getting this whole thing pieced together.

### R1D17 - April 13, 2018

I'm happy with the progress I've made on Notzee in the less than a week of time I've spent on it so far. Yesterday, one tweak I made which I forgot to mention (and which I was strangely excited about) was related to the padding around the dice elements. When I added the 5px border to an element that I "locked," I noticed that the container height grew and shrunk in response to me toggling this border. As it turned out, all I had to do to offset this effect was set a padding equal to the border height, then set the padding around the element to 0 (since the border added an equivalent number of pixels around the box when applied). It works like a charm; pretty cool, and simple. I'm sure I'll be using this technique in the future.

The scorecard section is turning out to be the trickiest part so far - there's a lot of information to fit into a small portion of screen real estate (on mobile, at least), so I'm trying to be thoughtful in my design. I've tested an accordion menu and currently have a vertical navbar with links to the upper, lower, and score sections, but I think I may have to go with a horizontal navbar in a future iteration. It's definitely a challenge and very much still a work in progress.

I've been slowly chipping away at The Algorithm Design Manual and took some time out to read a little bit today. It's very dense, but full of good info. I haven't read my Agile book recently, because while I find the information useful, it's not immediately applicable. I feel like I'll get a lot more mileage out of algorithms overall, so I'm prioritizing this text. It will take a while to get through because it's nearly 800 pages. Something interesting I learned is the difference between heuristics and algorithms: heuristics may do a good job at solving a problem without providing any guarantee, but algorithms will always produce a correct result.

### R1D18 - April 15, 2018
Took the weekend off to relax and spend some time with my family, but I'm back at it tonight! I stepped away from Notzee for a minute (after playing several games of real Yahtzee and losing horribly, for the most part) and returned to freeCodeCamp's front-end track, which I last worked with in November. I picked up on the weather app lesson, where the goal is to make an API call using AJAX functionality combined with browser geolocation to give the user a snapshot of their local weather. 

I'd previously gotten the weather app working and started trying to make it much more ambitious and even gamify it (by working in some sort of reward/avatar system), but on my second attempt I think I'll keep it much more attainable and dialed back. Also different this time is my choice to use vanilla JavaScript rather than jQuery. jQuery certainly makes a lot of things cleaner by abstracting it away, but I think I'll ultimately get more value out of looking at what's going on under the hood when using the jQuery library's functions. I may choose to use jQuery in future projects for the sake of simplicity (or perhaps a modified version which contains strictly what I'll need), but for now I'm doing everything "manually," so to speak.

It turns out that the anatomy of an AJAX request is indeed quite involved, but it's helped me better understand what's going on. Also, in order to get it working, I had to wrap my code in a closure to make sure everything is within the same scope. I still don't *fully* understand closures, but I think I'm starting to catch on. [Here's my living project page on CodePen](https://codepen.io/jaredcaraway/pen/yKmLNZ?editors=1012) which, for the sake of limiting the number of Pens I have active, I won't fork (one of the things I love about coding locally with Git is that I'm inherently creating snapshots of everything along the way). So if you're reading this in the future, what I'm talking about in the present will have changed. If that's the case...just play along and use your imagination.

Getting the user's location from the browser requires calling the asynchronous `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` method with a callback function as an argument (which accepts as a parameter the potentially returned `position` object) which will run if the geolocation is successful, and you can pass in a second callback to run if geolocation is blocked by the client (or is not available). In the success callback, I save the latitude and longitude coordinates to less unwieldy variables and make my AJAX call. This log is starting to run long, so I'll leave out the nitty gritty details...but if you're really interested, [the MDN docs on the subject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started) are (as is usually the case) thorough and recommended by this developer. I'll be back tomorrow with more!

### R1D19 - April 16, 2018
One important thing I've learned while working on my freeCodeCamp weather app in CodePen (since fCC requires you to submit a link to your project on said platform) is that I absolutely hate working without version control. I'd like to be able to incrementally commit and save my progress in such a way that I can view a log and rewind if I make a mistake, but as far as I know (please correct me if I'm wrong!), there's no way to do so on the free version of CodePen. So every change I make is basically permanent...it's a disconcerting feeling. Not only that, but CodePen's workspace is pretty cramped for the small screen of my laptop (I haven't been working on two computers lately). I far prefer the tabbed interface in VSCode. I'm going to finish this current project out in CodePen, since I don't think I've got much more to go before I call it complete, but starting with the next one I plan to develop locally, backing it up to a Github repo and copying and pasting the final product into CodePen for submission when it's all good to go. I have absolutely nothing against CodePen, but the way I'm using is suboptimal, I think.

That said, I've made some good progress on the weather app. I have been focusing entirely on functionality so far and, save for the icon reflecting the current weather condition, I'm just about done with that portion of the project. Over the next day or two I'll work on the CSS and it should be ready to submit in short order. I'm extremely excited to move one step closer to my certificate of completion. I haven't been tracking my time but, according to fCC's course outline estimates, I'm probably 150 hours into the front end material.

I'm not going to use it in my "production" code, but I learned about the prepend method tonight which allows you to insert an element as the first child of a parent. I originally had the temperature as a `<div>` containing a `<span>` which would contain the units, and I planned to prepend the current temperature before the units (Celsius/Fahrenheit) `<span>`. I scrapped that idea and decided to instead wrap the temperature integer and units in their own respective `<span>` tags within a `<div>` that functions as a container for the two.

But I am le tired, so I'm going to call this a night and end the log here so I can get in bed. Catch y'all on the flip side!

### R1D20 - April 17, 2018
I am one-fifth of the way through this round of the challenge today, and I almost can't believe how quickly the time has flown by...I've got mixed emotions about it. The more time passes and I continue to practice and expose myself to these development concepts, the more quickly I'll arrive at a level of proficiency and competency that will get me hired on somewhere. On the flip side, I want to make sure that I'm enjoying what I'm doing and really taking note of all this information so it doesn't immediately get pushed out the back of my mind by new stuff. I think I'm doing a good job at that so far, but it's something I think I should remain mindful of. As I go back over stuff I've done before, I recognize a lot but have to brush up on some things. As with mastery of any other skill, I know it's just a mastery of repetition and iteration, making mistakes and correcting them, and making sure I know what not to do next time to prevent those specific errors from happening again...in theory.

For the weather icon portion of my app, I am using a third-party icon font. The developer provides a list of classes to drop in when the API I'm using returns a certain code, and I initially wanted to load those into an associative array (changed my mind after working on it more); the trick is that the list he provides is not comma separated, and I'll need commas between each element in order to achieve what I'm after.

I couldn't do it manually, because there are 177 elements and that would be *way* too time-consuming. A find and replace wouldn't work, because the terms I am searching for don't have the exact same pattern. This brought me back to the technique that I love and respect and, mostly, fear: regular expressions. Regex is *incredibly* powerful and amazing, but the syntax is pretty unwieldy and alien. I know it'll come to me with time and practice, but since I haven't worked with it in a while, getting my regex just right took a little bit of wrangling. But I did it, and I feel accomplished! I won't end up using the list, but I got some more regex experience, and that certainly doesn't hurt.

I got the weather icon working and, mirroring the example freeCodeCamp provides, I added a little CSS animation to it. However, I added my own twist - I made mine rotate around the Y-axis, which gives it more of a 3D effect. I think this counts as my very first CSS animation (if I've done any previously, I don't recall them). I learned how to create a list of keyframes, experimented with different animation properties, and finally got it to a point that I'm satisfied with. Again, I see so much potential in this - it's all a matter of me playing around some more with it. I'm going to do a little more styling and call this project done.

On a side note, I ran into an issue on this runthrough of the project that I experienced when I did it previously. When trying my demo out in Firefox, the geolocation wasn't working. CodePen is HTTPS and my API is HTTPS, so I was baffled. After some Googling, it appears that this is an issue with Ubuntu (I'm running Mint, but it's based on Ubuntu) which was patched in the not-so-distant past. I was also running the default installation of Firefox that came with my OS and, even though I update my software daily in most cases, it was a package-based version. It appears that the package that that version of Firefox was using may have been out of date; I uninstalled via `apt remove` and downloaded and decompressed the most recent version from Firefox's website...and it worked with no issue. I can't pinpoint exactly what was going wrong, but I'm glad to know that it wasn't entirely user error...in this case, I can justifiably point the finger at someone else 😝.

I'm looking forward to moving onto the next project...I'm not going to get too hung up on this one, I just want to get the basics completed and then press onward.

### R1D21 - April 18, 2018
I can't take it anymore. I am switching over to Git and my local dev environment mid-project to finish this weather app out. It just gives me reassurance knowing I have that safety net, plus random people can't stop in and gawk at my crappy-looking app while it's under construction. I want to test out features in branches and I just can't do that in CodePen.

However, I've run into a major headache (which I think, or at least hope, will largely be limited to this particular project). Since I'm running a local server, it's not HTTPS by default. So, I thought, this must be the issue. But to enable HTTPS, I need an SSL certificate. So I generated a certificate/key pair with OpenSSL and configured my VSCode extension, Live Server, which allows you to preview your page on a local server with a single click...JavaScript still didn't work. Looked up another tutorial and tried again. Moved over to Apache, generated another certificate from yet another tutorial, and still nothing. I began getting extremely frustrated, because how could such a seemingly simple thing be so complicated? What a headache.

Then it occurred to me to go back and look at my Pen and make sure I wasn't leaving anything out. I'd copied everything over, right? Right. No, wait. I copied everything that I'd typed *into* CodePen...but CodePen provides certain things for you by default for simplicity's sake. Including the basic HTML framework. Including the `<script>` tag which links your HTML to your JavaScript. I'd included the pertinent CSS links, but I had not linked my script. My HTML file had no idea a script even existed, so *of course* the geolocation wasn't working. Nothing was working.

It was a bittersweet discovery. I felt more than a little foolish for beating my head against a wall, trying to troubleshoot for the higher-level stuff before I even bothered checking the foundational issues. On the other hand, I was seriously relieved that I finally got my app working in my dev environment, now with version control. It was truly a valuable learning experience for me, though. I wasted a lot of valuable time I could've spent coding, but I'm certain I'll never make the same mistake again. If it was an IT issue, I'd basically skipped the "try turning it off and back on again" step. Or even the "check to make sure it's plugged in" step. It was so obvious that I didn't even think to check it. But now I know - a hard lesson learned, but definitely a lesson!

I've got a couple of interviews tomorrow (non-coding, unfortunately, but interviews all the same), so this is where I say *adieu*. I look forward to making some more substantial progress tomorrow!

### R1D22 - April 19, 2018
Now that I got my dumb little issue solved with my weather app, I'm back at it. For the purposes of submitting to freeCodeCamp and moving forward, I'm literally just going to mimic the provided example app, but I may revisit it in the future to refactor and add additional features. The weather API I'm using provides a *lot* of data that I could display, so I could potentially turn my very basic app into a more full-featured one. Not that the world is in desperate need of yet another weather app, but it would be good coding practice for me.

Tonight I've mainly been converting my app over to Bootstrap 4. At some point, I want to come back and also refactor it to use straight up CSS with flexbox and media queries, but BS4 at least lets me get it done quickly so I can get the core concepts down. That's what I'm mainly interested in at this point - an overhead view from which I can zoom in over time. I'd also like to come back and redo the app using a JS framework for the experience.

There's not much interesting to report on tonight, because everything I have been doing has really been nitpicky presentational stuff which would be boring to describe in detail. But I *did* get my coding for the day in, and that's what really counts.

And now I'm submitting my barebones version of the weather app to freeCodeCamp. Next on the agenda: the Wikipedia viewer! Stay tuned.

### R1D23 - April 20, 2018
I began the Wikipedia Viewer today, and I can tell it's going to be great experience working with a more complex API. So far I've set up the interface for the app, which will allow the user to click a link to get a random Wiki page as well as enter a search term to pull up a list of the closest pages matching the entered search term.

I've got the random page function working already, mainly because Wikipedia provides a special API endpoint specifically for random pages. I created a link element on the page with an event listener that navigates to the specified random page endpoint in a new tab when clicked. I've also got the search field hooked up and configured to recognize when the Enter key is hit. When I sit down at my computer again (tomorrow, if I can find time) I plan to read more about the API to see how to formulate a proper query using the inputted data.

This is going to be another exercise in using AJAX, and it will eventually give me some more practice working with CSS animations, too (though I'm saving that part for after the core functionality is working to my satisfaction). I've also been committing to Git like a madman and doing my best to exercise sensible branching discipline when working on new features, so if I get too far off on a path that isn't working out, I can always return to center with master and branch off again to try something else. I have a love/hate relationship with Git...I think it really is an amazing tool, but it is going to be a long-term learning experience to understand it thoroughly. That said, I wouldn't dream of working on a project without it at this point. It's extremely valuable.

### R1D24 - April 21, 2018
Most of my coding time today was spent exploring the Wikipedia API. I preferred to figure it out myself rather than directly Googling for the answer or referring to the fCC forums; it's how I learn best. It took a good hour or so of going down the Wiki rabbit hole, but I finally figured out how the parameters I need to include in my GET request to return the data I needed. I've got a submitQuery function set up and added a conditional statement to only submit a search query when text was typed in the search input field. I also created a couple of strings, stored as variables, to sandwich around the search query, sinc the only thing that will be changing is the search term.

Tomorrow I plan to finish coding a fully functional search field which, at the very least, will `console.log` the JSON response with summaries for articles potentially matching the search term. After that, the big challenge will be properly displaying the results, animating the search field, and generally making it look good. I still have a lot of work to do when it comes to design proper, but I'm satisifed with the rate at which I'm picking up the back-end skills I've been chipping away at.

Another short log today since I'd otherwise just be rambling on about the API a lot, but I'll be back again tomorrow!

### R1D25 - April 22, 2018
Again, today I spent most of my time trying to make sense of the MediaWiki API (which is used for querying Wikipedia). The documentation is extensive, but often not very helpful. This is definitely the most complex API I've used to date, which is why it's taking me so long to figure out. There are multiple different methods for searching via this API, and I struggled to figure out the proper way. I still have not looked at the source code on the provided CodePen example, because I've been determined to struggle through and get it working of my own accord. It's like solving a puzzle; I won't get anywhere (or have any fun) if I just look up the solution. What would be the point?

I actually got the search function of my app working on a fundamental level pretty quickly. I hit a sticking point related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) which is a security feature that I can't say I understand on a deep level, but it's supposed to limit a user's vulnerability to third-party attackers and prevent them from injecting malicious resources without your permission. I was initially unable to get a response from my requests to the MediaWiki API, but the solution simply required adding an additional parameter, `origin: *`. The deeper I get into my journey into developerhood, the more I realize that so much of being successful at this involves leaning on others who have gone through the same headaches. In my case, I'm lucky enough to have Google and years' worth of archived posts to refer to; I can't imagine getting anywhere a decade or more back when information wasn't as abundant. At that point, having a personal network of people in the field probably would have been essential.

The issue I had with the responses for hours was that I couldn't get the page summary (extract) to return. The extract is basically just a configurable summary of the page, and in this case I only needed the first sentence. I figured out how to see "snippets," which is what I thought I needed, but they include HTML and appear to cut off after a fixed number of characters, often in midsentence or even the middle of a word, and don't appear to be configurable. The tricky part about this API is that there are so many parameters you can use in your query, some of them dependent on one another; I had to find the right combination of params to include to return the information that's relevant to my search. I was getting close to calling it a wrap for the night and letting it marinate while I slept, but I finally got the exact response that I needed. Estimating conservatively, I've probably spent no fewer than six to eight hours of research time just figuring how to properly formulate the query necessary to return the right info. It feels so good.

As anxious as I am to push forward on this project tonight now that I've cleared that hurdle, I'm going to take care of myself, get some sleep, and return to it tomorrow when I'm feeling fresh. Binge coding may satisfy me temporarily, but staying up late often throws me out of balance the next day and has a net negative effect on my mental well-being.

### R1D26 - April 23, 2018
Today was slightly different. I didn't get as much time to code as I would have liked, but I did get on Upwork and start sifting through posting and applying to ones that I thought I could realistically do. The thing about that platform is getting your foot in the door to get at least one review so people will take you seriously. I'm not worried so much about how much I make initially, I just want the work and good reviews so I can build a reputation on that platform.

Anyway, I submitted several proposals, hoping for the best...and I got a bite on one. It's outside of my realm of usual experience with past work (mainly, WordPress sites), but it's in line with what I've been working on more recently. Basically, the person who posted the gig wants to post a new entry in his CRM (which has a beautifully documented API) and have that create a new item entry on his eCommerce platform (which is also very thoroughly documented). I have not used either API, but I have *used APIs* and know how to research and how to work with WordPress, so I feel qualified to get the job done. Now it's just a matter of him accepting my quote and my timeline. I padded my timeline to allow for more than enough time to get to know the API, test functionality, and potentially even turn it around with time to spare. If I don't get the gig, no big loss. I'll just keep pushing forward and use what I learned this go-round in my next interaction with a potential Upwork client.

Returning to the Wikipedia Viewer app, I plugged the query I built yesterday into my code and tested it...and confirmed that I am getting the *exact same* results as the freeCodeCamp example app. I never looked at the script source a single time; I did it all through the power of Google and MediaWiki's nightmare of an API. It really is the ugliest API I've worked with so far. Even the two APIs I looked up for the project I'm bidding on through Upwork today looked like a cakewalk by comparison. Maybe that was part of the reason for fCC including this app - if you can learn to use this API, you should be good to work with most modern, reasonably documented ones.

For the first time, I created a project board in Github for this app. It's kanban like Trello, which I've used extensively and enjoy, but with fewer features. That's not a bad thing; Trello is honestly a little too involved for my purposes, and I like the ability in Github to convert a card directly to an issue. I rounded out the night's work on the app by moving a card to the Done column: Shift the controls (get random wiki and search) from vertical center to the top of the page when a search is performed to make way for the search results below. Tomorrow I plan to plug in the actual search results. For a project like this, I can easily see myself coming back with something like Vue or Angular to componentize it and get some framework practice.

I haven't given up on my Notzee app, but I'd really like to get this fCC front-end course out of the way so I can say I've completed it (and, of course, to get the valuable experience gained along the journey).

### R1D27 - April 24, 2018
Man, I'm glad I have my repos backed up remotely. I was in the middle of working on the Wikipedia app today and my computer froze, so I had to do a hard restart. When I booted back up, I found that my local Git repo had somehow corrupted. Fixing it was as simple as deleting the local copy and cloning the remote again. Now that I know that such failure is a possibility, I think I'm going to be pushing even more frequently than I was before. Luckily, I hadn't made many commits and I can easily replicate the work I'd done. This is just one of the beautiful things about version control.

Also on the topic of Git, I made a minor - but important - tweak to my workflow: I added a dev branch. Until now, I've mainly been working with just a master and feature branches. The dev branch will now serve as a buffer for me to merge completed branches into when I feel they're done, and once I hit what I consider to be a milestone and am comfortable with the dev branch, I'll go ahead and merge it down to master. I've dabbled with semantic versioning on a previous project and am not ready to add that to my list of skills just yet, but I think it'll be essential once my projects reach a greater degree of complexity.

I got a response to my proposal on Upwork - I agreed to a lower price in an effort to work with the potential client's budget, and the client accepted my proposed timeline of two weeks to allow me time to properly research, play around with the APIs, and test to make sure everything is working. So I've confirmed the deal, and I have now officially landed my first client on the Upwork platform! I'll probably be shifting my focus from the freeCodeCamp curriculum temporarily, because this project is going to require some homework.

And finally, on the Wikipedia viewer front, I added in logic that clears the search field and resets the view if search results are displayed. On a basic level, all I really need to do is parse the JSON data returned from the API call and load it into `<div>`s in the results area. I'll still have a fair amount of tweaking to do on the interface, since it's currently a barebones setup.

### R1D28 - April 25, 2018
Today my client gave me access to his WordPress site as well as his CRM, but before he provided that information I started doing some homework on my side. I needed to set up a local WordPress dev environment, so I set up a fresh copy via WordPress CLI, which was easy enough. I've typically used an all-in-one local server application such as XAMPP, which includes PHP, Apache, and MySQL and handles all the configuration for you, but this time I did everything manually - configured wp-config.php, created a new user/db in MySQL from the commanded line, and enabled the pertinent modules in Apache to get WordPress running.

This took a little longer than expected when I ran into a permissions issue. After a lot of Googling, I figured out that I needed to change ownership of my /var/www directory to give WordPress read & write access. At long last, I got everything properly configured and installed WooCommerce. I did some minimal configuration, then began researching the WooCommerce and Podio APIs I will be using. My next challenge is going to be figuring out the best way to extract data from Podio and import it into WooCommerce. After examining the data I'll be working with, it appears that I'll need to develop a script to run in the middle to do some very minor processing before importing it into WooCommerce.

Since WordPress is based on PHP and run on Apache, Node is out of the question. I will need to decide whether a PHP-based server-side script vs. a client-based JS script will be more appropriate. Since I will be making use of Podio's webhooks, I suspect I may be forced to go with a server-based solution in PHP; I can't see at this point how I'll be able to pull off JS, but I'll do at least a little more digging before making a final decision. I really like working with JavaScript, but I have worked with PHP previously due to working with WordPress sites in the past and I welcome the chance to freshen up my skills.

Bedtime now, though.

### R1D29 - April 26, 2018
Work continues today on the API connection project. Podio offers a PHP library, so I installed it and created a simple test PHP script using their sample code. After a little bit of finagling, I got it to successfully connect to a demo app I've created. Podio is structured hierarchically with workspaces at the upper level, containing different apps (sort of like boards in Trello) within which are contained items. This test script I've created so far connects to the demo app and simply returns a count of the items contained within.

For the webhook portion, I think I'll be able to route the URL call through WordPress with a rewrite rule. This basically allows for you to call custom PHP scripts via routing without having to install a completely different framework/library to do so. I'll have to do a bit more research to understand it fully, but it appears to be the best step. From there I'll have a script which handles the webhook call, does some processing of the data, and sends it through to the WooCommerce REST endpoint to create a draft product.

I found a free utility called ngrok which allows you to create a tunnel to your localhost from an external website for purposes such as...testing webhooks. I installed it and added a webhook pointing to the randomly generated URL provided by ngrok and checked the requests log, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the request went through. I am now researching how to route and handle requests with PHP. I'm going to set up a route that directs the request to a basic PHP file that responds to the webhook to verify it once, and after that will take the next necessary step to send a properly formulated POST request to the WooCommerce API.

Mostly, I spent hours today configuring my local server and figuring out how to deal with requests to my localhost through ngrok. I haven't yet been able to get the webhook to verify, but I feel like I'm at least getting close.

### R1D30 - April 29, 2018
I've made some substantial progress on my current API-based back end project, and I've also run into some frustrations.

The API for Podio is confusing, to say the least. There's a main API documentation, and then there are libraries in a handful of popular languages with their own documentation to refer to. I'm working in PHP for this project, so I've been working with that specific library. The problem is that the code examples it gives are incomplete, which leaves the user to debug the code which, in theory, should be working already. The project is also several years abandoned, and if you want help, you've got to post a question on StackOverflow and tag it with #podio. The main documentation says that responses to API requests will be returned in JSON format, but they're actually returned as an array-based object. This wouldn't really bother me if they didn't have two sets of documentation telling me two different things. Oh well - I'll still be able to make it work all the same.

The good news is that I have gotten the webhook to verify and Podio now sends an event every time a new item is created, which is exactly what I needed it to do. I still need to look into WordPress rewrite rules, as I think that'll be the way to go; this will let me receive the request at an endpoint with a vanity URL. This project has been a great exercise in PHP, for sure, and it's also taught me that I like JavaScript way more than PHP. They serve different purposes, and of course both have their strengths, but I'm looking forward to spend more time working on Node-based projects in the future over Apache. I'm getting comfortable with Apache and all, but Node is a lot quicker to pick up. That said, I know more about Apache since I've spent more time with it...but I'm not married to it.

Tomorrow I'm hoping to make some more progress on taking the response object from Podio, pulling out the necessary fields, and converting them into a format that I can use in my query to WooCommerce's REST API.
